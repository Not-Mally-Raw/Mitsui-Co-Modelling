## Code Patterns Added

### GPU Detection Pattern
```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
n_gpus = torch.cuda.device_count()
print(f'Number of GPUs available: {n_gpus}')
```

### Multi-GPU Training Pattern
```python
model.to(device)
if n_gpus > 1:
    print(f'Using {n_gpus} GPUs with DataParallel')
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
    batch_size = batch_size * n_gpus
```

### Conditional Training Pattern
```python
if train_model and not os.path.exists('model.pth'):
    # Training code
    # Save model
else:
    # Load cached model
    print('Using cached model')
```

### DataParallel-Aware Saving Pattern
```python
if n_gpus > 1:
    torch.save(model.module.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
else:
    torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
```

### Optimized DataLoader Pattern
```python
DataLoader(
    dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,
    shuffle=False,  # Important for time series!
    num_workers=2,
    pin_memory=True
)
```
